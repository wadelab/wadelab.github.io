<p><br />Vischeck is a webpage for simulating and correcting color vision deficiencies. It was originally launched in <a href="http://https://web.archive.org/web/20000817130422/http://www.vischeck.com/">2000</a> by Robert Dougherty and Alex Wade. In those days we were both post-docs in a neuroscience lab at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/vista/cgi-bin/wandell/">Stanford</a>. <a href="https://mindstronghealth.com/team/robert-bob-dougherty-phd/">Bob</a> now works for Mindstrong and <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/alex-wade/">Alex</a> is at the University of York.<br />
<br />This is a rebuild of the original site - we have switched to a client-side Javascript implementation which is just a better way to do it. But we are still learning how to make this work so bear with us. 
<br />In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/Distrotech/gimp/blob/master/modules/display-filter-color-blind.c">Code</a> from the original Vischeck simulation is now in the <a href="https://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> image processing package. And <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">there</a> <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/">are</a> some very nice other sites that do more or less the same thing. But we were the first :)</p>
